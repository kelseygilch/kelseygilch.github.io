	<div id ="content">
 <p> I am a senior at Tufts University studying biology and computer science. I am from Scottsdale, Arizona and was born in Hong Kong. 

I love to travel and learn about different cultures through their food. I feel that food is a fantastic way to discover a new place and there is nothing more exciting than finding a local establishment that encompases the atmosphere of a city. I hope to start a travel and food blog that highlights hidden and well-established restaurants in order to get a better understanding of a place.
